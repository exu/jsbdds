/**
 *  Develop a recently-used-list class to hold strings uniquely in Last-In-First-Out order.
 *
 *  A recently-used-list is initially empty.
 *  The most recently added item is first, the leastrecently added item is last.
 *  Items can be looked up by index, which counts from zero.
 *  Items in the list are unique, so duplicate insertions are moved rather than added.
 *  Optional extras:
 *  Null insertions (empty strings) are not allowed.
 *  A bounded capacity can be specified, so there is an upper limit to the number of items contained,
 *  with the least recently added items dropped on overflow.
